## About

This is my personal portfolio website intended to present my projects, skills, and contact details in a clean, modern layout. It uses a component-driven React structure with Tailwind CSS for styling and is deployed on Vercel.

git clone https://github.com/SaRaVaNaN0504/Personal_portfolio.git
cd Personal_portfolio

## Build & deploy

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

**Deploy on Vercel**

1. Connect this GitHub repo to your Vercel account.
2. Ensure the build command is `npm run build` and the output directory is `dist` (Vite default).
3. Vercel will automatically deploy on push to the default branch.

*Config note:* this repo already contains a `vercel.json` file—verify its settings in Vercel if you need custom redirects or headers.

## Accessibility, SEO & Performance (quick checklist)

* Add meaningful `alt` attributes to all images.
* Ensure heading structure is semantic (`h1` → `h2` → ...).
* Add meta tags: `title`, `description`, `og:*` tags for social previews.
* Add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to external links.
* Use `loading="lazy"` for offscreen images.
* Keep bundle size small: avoid including large libraries unnecessarily.
* Run Lighthouse audit locally and fix high-priority accessibility and performance issues.

## Contributing

If you want to suggest improvements:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-change`.
3. Commit your changes and open a pull request describing what you changed and why.

## Known issues / TODO

* Add a contact form that posts to a serverless function or third-party (Formspree/Netlify/Vercel function).
* Add unit/integration tests (Jest + React Testing Library).
* Improve SEO metadata and add sitemap / robots.txt.

## License

This repo is open for others to fork. Add a LICENSE file if you want a specific license (MIT is common for personal portfolios).
